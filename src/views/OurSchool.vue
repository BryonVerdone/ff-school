                We propose to host, throughout the year, four cohorts of 11
                weeks each using our online platform. Each cohort will be designed for 60 students, 20 per
                region, with one paid, trained instructor per region teaching
                via our online platform twice a week, aided by volunteer mentor
                coaches. For our Spring session we will host a North American cohort, a European cohort, an African cohort, and a LATAM cohort. We hope to teach cohorts of 60 students total
                four times a year:

                Front-End Foxes School is a part-time program, taught twice a
                week in the evenings for 11 weeks per cohort - perfect for working women, students and
                moms. We will ALWAYS be free of charge for students with no
                strings attached. By the end of the program you will have learned the basics of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and will have built four projects plus a portfolio web site built in React.js to showcase your skills.
              </p>

                Our programs are designed for women students. While we teach remote cohorts, it is still important to ensure that our student groups are women only. To this effect, we ask that students, when applying, self-certify as women. Membership in a cohort can be revoked if self-identification is found to be false.</p>
