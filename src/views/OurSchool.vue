                Front-End Foxes School is a part-time program, taught twice a
                week in the evenings for 5 weeks per cohort - perfect for working women, students and
                moms. We also offer ad hoc asyncronous classroom learning. We will ALWAYS be free of charge for students with no
                strings attached. By the end of the program you will have learned the basics of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and will have built four projects plus a portfolio web site built in React.js to showcase your skills.

                Our programs are designed for women students. While we teach remote cohorts, it is still important to ensure that our student groups are women only. To this effect, we ask that students, when applying, self-certify as women. Membership in a cohort can be revoked if self-identification is found to be false.</p>
