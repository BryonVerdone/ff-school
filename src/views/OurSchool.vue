                We propose to host, throughout the year, four cohorts of 11
                weeks each. Each cohort will be designed for 60 students, with
                one paid, trained instructor per region teaching via our online
                platform twice a week, aided by volunteer mentor coaches.

                Front-End Foxes School is a part-time program, taught twice a
                week in the evenings - perfect for working women, students and
                moms. We will ALWAYS be free of charge for students with no
                strings attached.

            We will teach the basics of web development starting with
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS and finally teaching React.js as a
            framework of choice. Our project-based curriculum allows new
            developers to create and maintain a web portfolio site and a GitHub
            presence for professional use. Paid instructors will be responsible
            for teaching the curriculum while volunteers will be sourced from
            our community of experienced developers. Each cohort of 60 will be
            comprised of three regional groups of 20. Due to time zone
            constraints, we propose that each seasonal cohort include a group
            from Asia, one from Europe/Africa, and one from the Americas. Thus,
            over a year, we propose to teach 12 groups for a total of 240
            students trained per year.
